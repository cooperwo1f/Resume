    }

    \resitem{\textbf{Languages:}
      Python, C, C++, ARM Assembly, JavaScript,
      \LaTeX, SQL, Rust
    }

    \resitem{\textbf{Concepts:}
      Embedded Systems, Analog Design (ADCs, OPAMPs, decoupling, biasing, signal integrity, grounding), \\
      ``Bare metal'' programming (no stdlib, no heap allocation), \\
      Linux (embedded, remote via SSH, general command line use, version control, build systems), \\
      %% Computer Architecture (designed and built a CPU from scratch using an FPGA), Power Systems, SCADA, PLC Ladder Programming, \\
      General understanding of object-oriented and functional programming, \\
      Can be writing usable code in a new language within a week
    }

    \resitem{\textbf{Soldering:}
      Can solder down to 0603 comfortably with minimal tools (iron and tweezers) \\
      Experience terminating connectors and providing adequate cable relief \\
      Fixing mistakes on circuit boards (cutting traces/soldering wires, pins/pads often significantly smaller than 0603) \\
      General resourcefulness - much faster/cheaper to buy connectors and reuse old cables
