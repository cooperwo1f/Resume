    \project{Server-less application for synchronising spreadsheet roster to calendar}{2019}{
      \item{Written in JavaScript}
      \item{Over 1,300 lines of code}
      \item{Uses Google Cloud free tier (strict resource management)}
      \item{Learnt many lessons about code management and versioning (ie. scope, version control utilisation)}
    }
    \project{Rust application for filtering pricing information from RS Components for low cost rapid prototyping}{2022}{
      \item{Written in Rust}
      \item{Essentially opposite of previous project - high(er) performance CLI tool}
      \item{Code written with minimal dependencies with greater attempt to be bug free}
      \item{Lesson learnt from previous project, do one thing and do it well}
    }
    \project{Custom PCB to receive and transmit CAN bus data}{2022}{
      \item{PCB has footprint of less than \(30 mm^{2}\) (efficient use of space, placement and routing considerations)}
      \item{Programming via SWO for smaller footprint, step debugging, and ITM trace printing}
      \item{Used to serialise sensor readings and provide longer transmission distances in high noise environments}
    }
    \project{High current buck converter to drive 12V audio amplifier from 18V DC supply}{2023}{
      \item{Allows 18V power tool batteries to efficiently power 12V devices}
      \item{Design process involved considering alternatives methods such as linear regulation, \\
        reviewing costs of existing devices, selecting complimentary components to increase device performance}
      \item{Fulfils application requirements while remaining passively cooled}
      \item{PCB designed to fit tolerances of existing enclosure}

    \project{Roster calendar synchroniser rewrite}{2024}{
      \item{Rewrote original project in Python, with minimum external dependencies}
      \item{Works as a grouping of tools for doing each individual step}
      \item{Provides isolation between each tool, allowing them to be tested and debugged easily}
      \item{Actual application is just a script that runs each tool in a chain}

    \project{Wilderness Society GPS image processing and correlation}{2024}{
      \item{First time building a graphical interface for an application}
      \item{Meets requirements of non-technical people, tool adapts to their needs rather than them adapting to it}
      \item{Real-time image processing and transformation in OpenCV}
    }
    \project{Small-footprint microcontroller module}{2024}{
      \item{Standardise software development of future projects by building from the same base each time}
    }
    \project{2.4GHz transceiver module}{\emph{Ongoing}}{
      \item{First time designing antenna - project primarily used for experience}
      \item{Integrating with previously designed module to add wireless capability to future projects}
    }
