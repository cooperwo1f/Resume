    \project{Server-less application for synchronising spreadsheet roster to calendar}{2019}{
      \item{Written in JavaScript}
      \item{Over 1,300 lines of code}
      \item{Uses Google Cloud free tier (strict resource management)}
      \item{Learnt many lessons about code management and versioning (ie. scope, version control utilisation)}
    }
    \project{Rust application for filtering pricing information from RS Components for low cost rapid prototyping}{2022}{
      \item{Written in Rust}
      \item{Essentially opposite of previous project - high(er) performance CLI tool}
      \item{Code written with minimal dependencies with greater attempt to be bug free}
      \item{Lesson learnt from previous project, do one thing and do it well}
    }
    \project{Custom PCB to receive and transmit CAN bus data}{2022}{
      \item{PCB has footprint of less than \(30 mm^{2}\) (efficient use of space, placement and routing considerations)}
      \item{Programming via SWO for smaller footprint, step debugging, and ITM trace printing}
      \item{Used to serialise sensor readings and provide longer transmission distances in high noise environments}
    }
    \project{High current buck converter to drive 12V audio amplifier from 18V DC supply}{2023}{
      \item{Allows 18V power tool batteries to efficiently power 12V devices}
      \item{Design process involved considering alternatives methods such as linear regulation, \\
        reviewing costs of existing devices, selecting complimentary components to increase device performance}
      \item{Fulfils application requirements while remaining passively cooled}
      \item{PCB designed to fit tolerances of existing enclosure}
    }
    \project{Real-time audio signal processing in C}{2024}{
      \item{Written with only C libraries}
      \item{Wanted to experiment with Linux pipes and use them for real-time processing}
      \item{Audio samples piped to stdin and processed samples written to stdout, \\
        which can then be piped to stdin of aplay (or similar) for listening}
      \item{Design allows for several different (or the same) applications to be chained together for interesting results}
    }
    \project{Roster calendar synchroniser rewrite}{2024}{
      \item{Rewrote original project in Python, with minimum external dependencies}
      \item{Works as a grouping of tools for doing each individual step}
      \item{Provides isolation between each tool, allowing them to be tested and debugged easily}
      \item{Actual application is just a script that runs each tool in a chain}
    }
    \project{Lighting controller using Novation Launchpad and Launch Control}{2024}{
      \item{Want to be able to control lights using additional buttons and faders}
      \item{Actual implementation is quite easy, lighting consoles support OSC, messages sent over the network}
      \item{Age of Launchpad causes Windows 10 driver to be unstable, works much more reliably under Linux}
      \item{Originally Launchpad button presses from Raspberry Pi to Windows using custom socket implementation}
      \item{Eventually moved to Unix sockets communicating between programs \\
        running on the same Raspberry Pi to decrease latency}
      \item{Used Systemd units to manage starting, stopping, and restarting relevant hardware services \\
        when corresponding hardware is connected}
      \item{``Core'' system service is started at boot, all inputs are sanitised, \\
        all possible error states either correct themselves or trigger a service restart}
      \item{Rewrote launchpad receiver code in C using ALSA library to reduce IO CPU usage using by utilising poll}
    }
    \project{Wilderness Society GPS image processing and correlation}{2024}{
      \item{First time building a graphical interface for an application}
      \item{Meets requirements of non-technical people, tool adapts to their needs rather than them adapting to it}
      \item{Real-time image processing and transformation in OpenCV}
    }
    \project{Small-footprint microcontroller module}{2024}{
      \item{Standardise software development of future projects by building from the same base each time}
    }
    \project{2.4GHz transceiver module}{\emph{Ongoing}}{
      \item{First time designing antenna - project primarily used for experience}
      \item{Integrating with previously designed module to add wireless capability to future projects}
    }
